# untitled-auto-battler

An asynchronous auto battler that is actively being built in Godot.

The game's mechanics are inspired primarily by Teamfight Tactics and Super Auto Pets.

The current plan is to create a simple version of the game and publish it on itch.io for testing, feedback, and gauging interest.

Most of the code is public, though some files such as scripts relating to the PostgreSQL backend are excluded from the public repo.
